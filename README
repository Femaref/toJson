Simple helper to write json representations of structs to a http response.

In essence, the toJson.ToJson Method converts whatever interface is provided to a representation based
entirely on Slices/Maps/Primitive types.

If type implements the JsonWriter interface, the output of it is used instead of the normal algorithm.

Normal usage is

    err := toJson.WriteToJson(w, obj)


If you already have a marshable datatype, you can use toJson.WriteJson directly.
